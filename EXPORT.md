    * Config parsing
    * Handling TLS & HTTP connections
    * Storage and handling of asymmetric crypto material
    * En-/Decryption of data
    * Storing files in an integrity protected manner

All functionality is implemented on top of OpenSSL without adding new cryptographic algorithms.
Therefore, this software is no subject to restrictions regarding export regulations.
